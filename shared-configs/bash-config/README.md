## First-time installation

After getting everything setup, you can just run `updateSettings` to load the latest version of these config files to your machine.

For the initial set up, run the following code in the terminal (with the correct path to this git repo):

```
source $PATH_TO_REPO/shared-configs/bash-config/bash_utils/system.sh
updateSettings
```
